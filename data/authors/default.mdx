My goal is to work as an Electrical Engineer developing America's infrastructure to better people's lives. Previously interning at HW Lochner in the Aviation division, I've contributed to diverse projects, from general aviation airport lighting and NAVAIDs to digital signage at major hubs like DFW International Airport.

One of my favorite niche aspects of Electrical Engineering is RF theory and how it fits in with my goal. Currently, I am the System Administrator at KANM Student Radio, where I fuse my engineering curiosity with creative expression. I help KANM navigate the ongoing process of gaining an FM radio license from the FCC and I am also a licensed amateur radio operator.

I believe that engineering is about impactful solutions, and I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities. Let's connect and make a difference together!
